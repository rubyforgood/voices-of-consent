# The enum of premissions
# We can turn this into a database model later if we need the flexibility
# It's possible to make these IDs instead of strings. I like the legibility of the strings, and given the likely size of the dataset, the additional performance of IDs feels unecessary at the moment. That said, it may still be a mistake to use strings instead of IDs, for which I apologize.
